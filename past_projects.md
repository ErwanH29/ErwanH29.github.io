					<h3>Cosmic Web Classification: NEXUS+ vs. DisPerSE</h3>
				</header>
                <b>Field</b>: Computational Cosmology <br>
                <b>Research</b>: Comparing two different algorithms investigating the cosmic web. <br>
                <b>Purpose</b>: The cosmic web defines the structure of our Universe on the largest scales. Understanding how this structure emerges lets us peer into the nature of our Universe, namely the way gravity acts on the largest scales and how it shapes our Universe. <br>

					<h3>The Milky Way and its Exotic Milisecond Pulsar Population</h3>
				</header>
                <b>Field</b>: Computational Astrophysics <br>
                <b>Research</b>: Investigating the possibility of Milky Way millisecond pulsars originative from the Large Magellanic Cloud. <br>
                <b>Purpose</b>: Millisecond pulsars are some of the most exotic celestial objects known in the Universe. The analysis aims to predict whether the asymmetrical kick velocity felt at birth may cause some of them to migrate between galactic systems and whether we should expect a surplus of its population lying on the outskirts of the Milky Way <br>

					<h3>Modelling Schools of Fish</h3>
				</header>
                <b>Field</b>: Active Matter <br>
                <b>Research</b>: Investigating the different emergent behaviours present in schools of fish. <br>
                <b>Purpose</b>: A recent development in physics has been to model biological systems with basic principles to understand behaviours emerging from such systems. Studying such systems also helps us develop new out-of-equilibrium frameworks for statistical physics. <br>

					<h3>Low-Frequency Radio Astronomy from the Moon</h3>
				</header>
                <b>Field</b>: Radio Astronomy <br>
                <b>Research</b>: Investigating the scientific benefits of a Lunar radio interferometer. <br>
                <b>Purpose</b>: With space agencies having their sights locked onto a Lunar base, the prospect of building a sensitive lunar interferometer becomes ever more enticing. With its ability to peer into the Dark Ages and possibly revolutionise cosmology, such an ambitious mission is worth to take a deeper look into. <br>

					<h3>Testing Modified Gravity Through Gravitational Waves</h3>
				</header>
                <b>Field</b>: Theoretical Cosmology <br>
                <b>Research</b>: Investigating the gravitational wave luminosity distance predicted by <i>f(R)</i> gravity. <br>
                <b>Purpose</b>: As successful as Einstein's theory of gravity is, we know it can't be the final answer as it doesn't work on the quantum scales. In hopes of better understanding the fundamental laws of our Universe, theorists devise theories of modified gravity, each of which has subtle differences from Einstein's theory. <br>

					<h3>The Hypothetical Population of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes In the Galactic Nucleus</h3>
				</header>
                <b>Field</b>: Computational Astrophysics <br>
                <b>Research</b>: Investigating the dynamics of a hypothetical intermediate mass black hole cluster. <br>
                <b>Purpose</b>: We have yet to understand how supermassive black holes form. Though not yet observed, the hypothetical intermediate-mass black holes may be the key and numerous papers have been published on them, from their proposed observation in clusters to their dynamical effects on environments. <br>
