					<h3>Cosmic Web Classification: NEXUS+ vs. DisPerSE</h3>
				</header>
                <b>Field</b>: Computational Cosmology <br>
                <b>Research</b>: Comparing two different algorithms investigating the cosmic web. <br>
                <b>Purpose</b>: The cosmic web defines the structure of our Universe on the largest scales. Understanding how this structure forms lets us peer into the nature of our Universe, namely the way gravity acts on the largest scales and to how common clusters of galaxies or voids arise. <br>

					<h3>Modelling Schools of Fish</h3>
				</header>
                <b>Field</b>: Active Matter <br>
                <b>Research</b>: Investigating the different emergent behaviours present in schools of fish. <br>
                <b>Purpose</b>: A recent development in physics has been to model biological systems with basic principles to understand some of their emerging behaviours. Studying such systems also helps us develop new out-of-equilibrium frameworks for statistical physics. <br>

					<h3>Testing Modified Gravity Through Gravitational Waves</h3>
				</header>
                <b>Field</b>: Theoretical Cosmology <br>
                <b>Research</b>: Investigating the gravitational wave luminosity distance predicted by <i>f(R)</i> gravity. <br>
                <b>Purpose</b>: As successful as Einstein's theory of gravity is, we know it can't be the final answer as it doesn't work on the quantum scales. In hopes of better understanding the fundamental laws of our Universe, theorists devise theories of modified gravity each of which having subtle differences with Einstein's theory. <br>

					<h3>The Hypothetical Population of Intermediate Mass Black Holes In the Galactic Nucleus</h3>
				</header>
                <b>Field</b>: Computational Astrophysics <br>
                <b>Research</b>: Investigating the dynamics of a hypothetical intermediate mass black hole cluster. <br>
                <b>Purpose</b>: We have yet to understand the formation history of supermassive black holes. Though not yet observed, the hypothetical intermediate mass black holes may form the building blocks for supermassive black holes and it is a worthy avenue of investigating their properties and their influence on clusters. <br>
