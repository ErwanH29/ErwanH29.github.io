					<h3>Cosmic Web Classification: NEXUS+ vs. DisPerSE</h3>
				</header>
                <b>Field</b>: Computational Cosmology <br>
                <b>Research</b>: Comparing two different algorithms investigating the cosmic web. <br>
                <b>Purpose</b>: The cosmic web defines the structure of our Universe on the largest scales. Understanding how this structure emerges lets us peer into the nature of our Universe, namely the way gravity acts on the largest scales and how it shapes our Universe. <br>

					<h3>Modelling Schools of Fish</h3>
				</header>
                Active Matter <br>
                <b>Research</b>: Investigating the different emergent behaviours present in schools of fish. <br>
                <b>Purpose</b>: A recent development in physics has been to model biological systems with basic principles to understand behaviours emerging from such systems. Studying such systems also helps us develop new out-of-equilibrium frameworks for statistical physics. <br>

					<h3>Testing Modified Gravity Through Gravitational Waves</h3>
				</header>
                <b>Field</b>: Theoretical Cosmology <br>
                <b>Research</b>: Investigating the gravitational wave luminosity distance predicted by <i>f(R)</i> gravity. <br>
                <b>Purpose</b>: As successful as Einstein's theory of gravity is, we know it can't be the final answer as it doesn't work on the quantum scales. In hopes of better understanding the fundamental laws of our Universe, theorists devise theories of modified gravity, each of which has subtle differences from Einstein's theory. <br>

					<h3>The Hypothetical Population of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes In the Galactic Nucleus</h3>
				</header>
                <b>Field</b>: Computational Astrophysics <br>
                <b>Research</b>: Investigating the dynamics of a hypothetical intermediate mass black hole cluster. <br>
                <b>Purpose</b>: We have yet to understand how supermassive black holes form. Though not yet observed, the hypothetical intermediate-mass black holes may be the key and numerous papers have been published on them, from their proposed observation in clusters to their dynamical effects on environments. <br>
